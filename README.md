# One Page Rules: Grimdark/Firefight House Rules
Adds a selection of extra rules to One Page Rules: Grimdark/Firefight, ported from https://fadwargame.com and designed to make gameplay a little more tactical and brutal!

The rules here make changes to charging and ranged combat. The intention of these rules is to make tactics like distractions, feints and pincer attacks more interesting and to reward slightly more clever tactics when there is a lot of terrain.

These rules sometimes overlap with existing rules (such as "boosts") from the advanced rules, for the most part, these rules can be stacked with the existing rules (common sense applies).

## Changes to standard actions

### Hold Action
If a unit with ranged weapons chooses not to move, they can shoot with a +1 bonus to quality.

### Charge Acion
When performing the "Charge" action, the unit gains a +4" boost to movement. If the unit moved at least 6" then they also gain a +1 bonus to quality check rolls to see if they hit.

## Changes to Ranged Combat

### Long Range
All ranged weapons can be shot at "long" range, which is double the weapons current range, but at a -2 penalty.

**For Example** A rifle with a range of 24" can be used to target an enemy model between 24" and 48", but the quality roll will suffer a -2 penalty.

## Reactions

### Reacting to a Charge
If a unit with ranged weapons has not acted this turn, they are the target of a charge and they have *line of sight* to the charging unit **before** they charge. The recipient of the charge may perform a reaction shot against the charging unit.

Range for the shots is considered to be based on the charging unit's starting position and the charging unit gains **no** bonuses from cover. The shooting unit also suffers a -1 penalty to hit due to them not being able to prepare their shots.

If a unit decides to use a reaction shot, then they cannot strike back and they will be considered to have acted this turn (they cannot act again).

## Improved Supression
Suppression rules remain as per the advanced rules, **however** they apply to all units (not selected as part of psycology) and also have the following changes/additions:

* Only the unit who recieved the most hits as the result of a charge (this includes from *reaction shots*) gains a token.
* A unit also gains a suppression token if they are shot at (even if the shot misses).
* Each suppression token also grants a +1 to defense rolls.
